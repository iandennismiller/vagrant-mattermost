# Vagrant Mattermost

This repository contains a Vagrant environment that will install and run [Mattermost](http://www.mattermost.org).  Optionally, this can also run a [Github integration](https://github.com/softdevteam/mattermost-github-integration) bot.

## Not for production

This is a pretty good start for anybody who wants to use Vagrant to manage their Mattermost server, but there are some rough edges.  Do not use this to manage your production servers.

## Installation

It is assumed that you have already installed [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

To install **vagrant-mattermost**, do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/iandennismiller/vagrant-mattermost.git
    cd vagrant-mattermost
    vi files/mattermost/nginx.conf
    vi files/mattermost-github-integration/config.py
    make requirements vagrant

For information about how to edit nginx.conf and config.py, see *Customization Instructions* below.

Once the machine has booted, you must create SSL certificates using [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/):

    su mattermost
    cd /home/mattermost/letsencrypt
    ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone

## Customization Instructions

Alter the following files within the repository:

- `files/mattermost/nginx.conf`
- `files/mattermost-github-integration/config.py`

### files/nginx.conf

- hostname: set this to your hostname

### files/mattermost-github-integration/config.py

- hostname: set this to your hostname
- mattermost_default_hook_url: provided by mattermost
- mattermost_secret: provided by mattermost

## Reference Implementation

This Vagrant environment is based on the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation procedure described in the official [Mattermost documentation](http://docs.mattermost.com/install/prod-ubuntu.html).  For posterity, the [documentation source](http://docs.mattermost.com/_sources/install/prod-ubuntu.txt) was snapshotted on 2016-05-21 and stored within this repository as [docs/prod-ubuntu.rst](https://github.com/iandennismiller/vagrant-mattermost/blob/master/docs/prod-ubuntu.rst).

## Github Integration

**Note**: In my estimation, the [github integration bot](https://github.com/softdevteam/mattermost-github-integration) is not secure enough to run on a production machine.  However, it's the [official bot for now](http://www.mattermost.org/community-applications/) and it's definitely sufficient for many purposes.
